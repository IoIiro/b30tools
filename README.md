# b30tools
Discord bot that can handle user's B30 data (dumbass)
Set the environment file and run the bat file (or the py directly if you aren't using windows)
Note that I'm still lazy to add a requirements.txt for you, install the necessary libraries that you'll need via the code!

+ Oh my where's the dot? change the "env" to ".env", unless this won't even work correctly.
